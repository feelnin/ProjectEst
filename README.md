# ProjectEst
Here contains my first hands-on full-stack project, using the framework Angular that is based in Typescritp for front-end. 
For back-end it was used C# with .Net Entity Core. The comunication with the database was made by using SQL lite.
This project back-end contais the four layers: Domain, persistence, aplication and Api (project of class).
Also for test of request it was used Postman and for control the code versioning control it was used Git.
